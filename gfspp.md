**Last Updated:** 18 September 2025

## Overview

We committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our mobile application.

## Information We Do Not Collect

We do not collect, store, use, or share any personal information from users of our app. This includes but is not limited to:

- Personal identifiers (names, email addresses, phone numbers)
- Device identifiers or advertising IDs
- Location data
- Usage analytics or behavioral data
- Contact information or address book data

- Any other personal or sensitive information

## App Functionality

GoFaxSMS operates using the GoFax SMS API. The app communicates with their servers using their API. There are no intermediary servers between your phone and the GoFax service that are under our control. (Your ISP on the other hand...)

## Third-Party Services

Our app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services that would collect your personal information. By it's very nature it uses GoFax's service; please see their privacy policy. We have no control over GoFax's Privacy Policy.

## Data Storage

No personal data is stored on our servers (I don't even have a server). Any data processed by the app remains solely on your device under your control and on GoFax's servers.

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any users, this includes children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal information, there is no personal data for you to access, correct, or delete. You maintain complete control over any data processed by the app on your device. Any information submitted to GoFax via their API is under their control.
